# Flutter Experiments

This repository is dedicated to the experiments I do in flutter. Something that might already be there, or somthing that I am trying out just for fun.

## Experiments

- [iOS Text Widget](#ios-text-widget---dec-2023)
- [Sort Visualizer](#sort-visualizer---june-2023)
- [Cred Scrollbar](#cred-scrollbar---nov-2022)
- [India Flag](#india-flag---aug-2022)
- [Three D Example](#three-d-example-aug-2022)
- [Flame Wave](#flame-wave---june-2022)

## A bit detailed:

### [iOS Text Widget - (Dec 2023)](https://x.com/immadisairaj/status/1738594580147355811)

This is a test/trying out the iOS Widget using Flutter. Using the [home_widget](https://pub.dev/packages/home_widget) pub package this was possible. It renders a widget into image which then communicates with the ios side using the home_widget and some custom code to show the image on the iOS Widget.

Sorry, the code isn't open-source for some reasons. But, can easily follow and get things like this done easily with [this codelab](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/flutter-home-screen-widgets#0).
